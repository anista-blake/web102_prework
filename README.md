## Notes

The only real challenges I faced were either simple syntax errors, such as when I messed up something as simple as a for loop, and figuring out how to utilize certain features given a couple examples, such as using both destructuring and the spread operator together. At the end of the day, I was able to grasp the concepts, I just need more practice with JavaScript.
